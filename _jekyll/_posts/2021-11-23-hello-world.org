Welcome to our blog! Here, you can catch up on stuff we've been toying
with, what we've learned in the process and stuff that, hopefully, you
can take away something from that.

* The Details

This blog is currently hosted on github pages CNAMED to our
domain. We try to make website completely usable without any
javascript; if you notice issues with javascript disabled, please let
us know. Comments are via [[https://github.com/giscus/giscus][giscus]], and require javascript.

Our stack uses jekyll, with our theme being forked from [[https://github.com/rahul-bothra/parchment][parchment]]. Our
choice of jekyll was motivated by its extensibility and our prior
experience with ruby. Since the two of us write in different formats
(markdown and org mode, for example) we couldn't go with a system that
didn't at least support the two, and hugo wasn't a good fit for us
since we're not as comfortable maintaining templates in its syntax.

* What's coming?

In the near future, we'll be writing on Phoenix and Kotlin
Multiplatform, and beyond that wherever our technical adventures take
us.

That's it for now. Before we leave, here's a funny snippet:

#+begin_src ruby
  config.aws_shared_credential_path = (
    ENV['AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIAL_PATH']
    unless ENV['AWS_CREDS_IN_SECRETS']
    then '/run/secrets/aws_credentials'
  )
#+end_src

;)

(I'm updating this post to test our build script.)
