 <p>Hello there! I&#8217;ve been planning to write a blog for a while - I&#8217;ve
  usually got more than a few thoughts kicking around in my head that
  would do me better if I wrote them down somewhere - but I think I&#8217;ve
  finally found a good reason to kick start it: advent of code and roc.</p>
<h1>What&#8217;s Roc?</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.roc-lang.org/">Roc</a> is a new and not yet released functional programming
  language. If you look at it purely from a syntax/features point of
  view, you might not find anything interesting about it, but I invite
  you to check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpQwtwVKAfU">this talk</a> by its creator, <a href="https://twitter.com/rtfeldman">Richard Feldman.</a> I
  think it goes into a lot of what made Roc stand out for me, namely:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The philosophy of &#8220;platforms&#8221;, which allows you to change <i>how</i>
    your code interacts with the rest of the world. Want a
    high-performance server implementation? Write the low-level IO in
    rust and plug in the logic in Roc. The advantage of this approach
    is that you can use &#8220;the right tool for the job&#8221;, and even go so
    far as to create a platform for a game or an app that allows
    users to safely script in Roc.</li>
  <li>A focus on performance: Roc is tapping into cutting edge research
    to make functional programming with immutable data structures
    almost as fast as writing low level procedural code. Don&#8217;t
    believe me? <a href="https://youtu.be/vzfy4EKwG_Y">Watch this.</a></li>
  <li>Pure FP with effects and structural typing.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Why Roc?</h1>
<p>I&#8217;m sure all I&#8217;ve mentioned so far would&#8217;ve at least piqued your
  interest if you like functional programming, as it did to me when I
  first learned about Roc. But while Roc is promising, it is not yet
  <i>ready</i>. As the website mentions, Roc is still under development,
  and definitely isn&#8217;t production-ready. The compiler is still in its
  early stages and in my first time messing around with roc code I ran
  into some pretty inscrutable compiler errors, including a bug which
  led to my code not even printing &#8220;Hello, world!&#8221; until I added an
  <code>await</code> <i>somewhere</i>.</p>
<p>This is all fine and expected for a language that&#8217;s so early in its
  development, but why use it for advent of code? Well, the biggest
  reason is that working with a very new language without the mature
  stdlib or ecosystem of a Java or even F# is that it&#8217;s a super
  interesting challenge. In preparationf or this year&#8217;s advent of
  code, I did a few of last year&#8217;s challenges in F#, and in most cases
  I got the correct answer by wrangling together <code>File.ReadLines</code>,
  regexes and <code>Seq</code> functions. It almost felt like cheating. Here&#8217;s
  one of my solutions in F#:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">INPUT_PATH</span>
<span class="o">|&gt;</span> <span class="nn">File</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">ReadLines</span>
<span class="o">|&gt;</span> <span class="nn">Seq</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">mapi</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="k">fun</span> <span class="n">idx</span> <span class="n">line</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span>
    <span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">currentIndex</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">idx</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">3</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="nn">String</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">length</span> <span class="n">line</span>
    <span class="n">line</span><span class="o">.[</span><span class="n">currentIndex</span><span class="o">])</span>
<span class="o">|&gt;</span> <span class="nn">Seq</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">filter</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="k">fun</span> <span class="n">ch</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">ch</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sc">&#39;#&#39;</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="o">|&gt;</span> <span class="nn">Seq</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">length</span>
<span class="o">|&gt;</span> <span class="n">printfn</span> <span class="s">&quot;%d&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>I definitely can&#8217;t do that in Roc, if only because proper support
  for File I/O in the CLI platform is just coming into shape. Writing
  more low-level code in a functional langauge is exactly the kind of
  challenge I want to take up!</p>
<p>Apart from that, I&#8217;m looking forward to stress testing the roc
  compiler as a user: What went wrong? What was I expecting? Why did
  it not work that way? and reporting it to the team so they can make
  it better. Heck, this might be what finally gets me into the depths
  of compilers!</p>
<h1>What&#8217;s coming?</h1>
<p>I&#8217;ll <i>try</i> to solve each AoC challenge on the day it comes out, but
  due to work and so on I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be able to meet that
  goal. I&#8217;ll definitely catch up to the ones I&#8217;ve missed over the
  weekends. Additionally, I&#8217;ll try to write a blog post for each
  solution where I had challenges with roc more than with the logic of
  the solution.</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s it for now. We&#8217;re off to the races!</p>
