Here, you can catch up on stuff we&amp;#8217;ve been toying
  with, what we&amp;#8217;ve learned in the process and stuff that, hopefully, you
  can take away something from that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Details&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog is currently hosted on github pages CNAMED to our
  domain. We try to make website completely usable without any
  javascript; if you notice issues with javascript disabled, please let
  us know. Comments are via &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/giscus/giscus&quot;&gt;giscus&lt;/a&gt;, and require javascript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our stack uses jekyll, with our theme being forked from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rahul-bothra/parchment&quot;&gt;parchment&lt;/a&gt;. Our
  choice of jekyll was motivated by its extensibility and our prior
  experience with ruby. Since the two of us write in different formats
  (markdown and org mode, for example) we couldn&amp;#8217;t go with a system that
  didn&amp;#8217;t at least support the two, and hugo wasn&amp;#8217;t a good fit for us
  since we&amp;#8217;re not as comfortable maintaining templates in its syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What&amp;#8217;s coming?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the near future, we&amp;#8217;ll be writing on Phoenix and Kotlin
  Multiplatform, and beyond that wherever our technical adventures take
  us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s it for now. Before we leave, here&amp;#8217;s a funny snippet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;aws_shared_credential_path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;ENV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIAL_PATH&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;unless&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;ENV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;AWS_CREDS_IN_SECRETS&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;/run/secrets/aws_credentials&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
